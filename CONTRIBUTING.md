# Contributing to Coldr

Thanks for thinking about contributing! Coldr is intentionally small and DX-focused‚Äîpull requests, issues, and ideas are all welcome.

## Getting started

1. **Fork & clone**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<you>/coldr.git
   cd coldr
   npm install
   ```

2. **Run the test suite**
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

3. **Explore the CLI locally**
   ```bash
   node bin/index.js init
   node bin/index.js schedule --dry-run
   ```

## Development workflow

- Use feature branches (`feat/‚Ä¶`, `fix/‚Ä¶`, `docs/‚Ä¶`).
- Keep commits focused; descriptive messages help a lot (`docs: update README for DX`).
- Add tests for behavioural changes‚ÄîVitest (unit) and the existing e2e suites are a good reference.
- Run `npm run lint` before opening a PR.

## Pull requests

Please include:

- A short summary of the change and the problem it solves.
- Screenshots or terminal output if the UX changes.
- Checklist results (tests, lint).

## Issues

Bug? Enhancement idea? DX papercut? Open an issue with:

- Environment (OS, Node version)
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected vs. actual behaviour

## Code of conduct

Be kind, stay constructive, and assume positive intent. This is a DX-first, builder-friendly space.
