- âœ… **Transparency** â€” Plain CSV and JSON files, no black boxes
- âœ… **Simplicity** â€” Two commands, five minutes to start your campaign
- âœ… **Cost-effective** â€” Free CLI, Resendâ€™s free tier often covers MVPs

**Perfect for:** Indie makers, Solopreneurs, Developers, bootstrapped startups testing ideas quickly, anyone who wants to run cold emails simply and transparently.

## Quick Start

### Install

```bash
npm install -g coldr
```

### Initialize Campaign

```bash
coldr init my-campaign
cd my-campaign
```

This creates:

```
my-campaign/
â”œâ”€â”€ config.json          # Campaign settings
â”œâ”€â”€ leads.csv            # Your contacts
â”œâ”€â”€ template.html        # Email template
â””â”€â”€ suppressions.json    # Opt-out list
```

### Configure

**1. Edit `config.json`:**

```json
{
  "sender": "Alice <alice@yourstartup.com>",
  "subject": "Quick question about {{company}}",
  "unsubscribeLink": "mailto:unsubscribe@yourstartup.com?subject=STOP", // optional, default is no unsubscribe link
  "perDay": 20, // optional, default is 20 emails per day
  "startDate": "2025-10-28T09:00:00+02:00", // optional, default is tomorrow
  "workDays": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5], // optional, default is all Monday to Friday
  "workHours": [9, 17] // optional, default is 9am to 5pm
}
```

**2. Add your contacts to `leads.csv`:**

```csv
email,firstName,company
bob@acme.io,Bob,Acme Corp
sarah@tech.co,Sarah,Tech Co
```

**3. Customize `template.html`:**

```html
<p>Hi {{firstName}},</p>

<p>I noticed {{company}} is working on [relevant topic].</p>

<p>Quick question: would you be open to a 15-minute intro call?</p>

<p>Best,<br />Alice</p>
```

### Schedule Emails

```bash
export RESEND_API_KEY=re_your_api_key
coldr schedule
```

**That's it.** Coldr schedules your emails and Resend handles the delivery.
